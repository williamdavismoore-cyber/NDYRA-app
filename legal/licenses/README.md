# Licenses & Attributions

This folder is the **single place** to document any third‑party media, fonts, icon sets, sound effects, music, stock footage, or other licensed assets.

Rules:
- If it ships, it must be documented here.
- No "temporary" licensed assets.
- If there is any doubt, do not merge.

See: `IP_GUARDRAILS.md` (repo root).
