HIIT56 QA REPORT — CHECKPOINT 2026-02-08_12 (CP12)

Scope (from Adjustments_2-8-23_2.docx):
- Logo size: ensure top-left logo is ~30% bigger (no distortion)
- Video volume control across the app (Vimeo embeds)
- Video load speed + fail-safe fallback
- Fold “HIIT56 Specials/Mash-Ups” under HIIT (listed last), not a standalone category

Automated / Script Checks
- node --check assets/js/site.js : PASS
- JSON parse check: categories_v1.json, categories_draft.json, videos_classes.json : PASS

Functional Checks (manual expectations)
- Header: logo visibly larger vs CP10 (CSS height set to 73px; width auto; object-fit contain)
- Category list: no standalone “HIIT56 Specials/Mash-Ups” tile
- HIIT category page: shows Specials/Mash-Ups section at bottom (only on HIIT)
- Video playback:
  - Cards open modal instantly
  - Poster shows immediately while iframe loads
  - If Vimeo iframe doesn't load within ~8s, fallback banner appears w/ “Open in Vimeo”
  - Custom volume slider + mute toggle overlay shown on modal + workout detail + move detail

Performance / UX improvements implemented
- Preconnect + DNS-prefetch injected for player.vimeo.com and i.vimeocdn.com
- Vimeo iframe src assignment deferred by requestAnimationFrame to reduce “blank” flash

Known constraints
- Programmatic volume control may be restricted on some mobile browsers (iOS often forces device-volume). UI remains visible; user can always use device volume or Vimeo controls.

Next QA focus (CP13)
- Thumbnail selection pipeline (William will circle back)
- Stripe/Supabase wiring (once credentials/deliverables are ready)
