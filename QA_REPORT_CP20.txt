QA Checklist

1) Member Timer Builder — Random Filters
PASS - UI shows Random move filters section.
PASS - "All moves (no filter)" is ON by default.
PASS - Selecting any muscle group automatically turns OFF "All moves".
PASS - Clearing all muscle group selections automatically turns "All moves" back ON.
PASS - Balance mode (round-robin) is ON by default and cycles through selected groups.
PASS - Strict mode (Require ALL selected groups) filters the pool as intersection.
PASS - Avoid Words still applies before group filtering.
PASS - No Repeats still prevents duplicates across the full generated workout (best-effort when pool is small).

Notes
- If filters are overly strict (small pool) the randomizer falls back to the base pool (avoid-words only) so the builder never "dead ends".

2) Member Timer — Time Cap Default Under-Cap Behavior
PASS - On /app/timer/, "If under cap" default selection is "Add finisher block".
PASS - Applying a cap larger than the workout total appends a single WORK finisher block to match the cap exactly.
PASS - Time cap pools still include transitions (and "Adjust All" remains default pool).

3) Regression Sanity
PASS - Timer beeps still fire on segment changes (work/rest/move transition/stage transition).
PASS - Beep volume slider still controls volume (requires user gesture on mobile browsers).
PASS - Builder still generates preview and exports JSON.
PASS - Service worker cache name updated to hiit56-cp20-static-v1.

Known Limitations (expected, pre-Supabase)
- Move tags are heuristic/title-based for now (good enough to start; can be refined once move tagging lives in Supabase).
- Saved workouts remain localStorage-only.
