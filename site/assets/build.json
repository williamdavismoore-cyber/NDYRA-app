  "notes": "CP32 (Blueprint v7): Step 1E Profile Screen + Step 1F Notifications. Adds full /app/profile UI with performance strip (local-only metrics), privacy settings modal (DB-first with local fallback), and My Posts feed. Adds /app/notifications UI wired to Supabase notifications table (demo mode supported). E2E reliability: static server now serves .mjs with application/javascript; Playwright now generates HTML report by default. FYP demo feed now has embedded fallback demo posts so .post-card always renders."
